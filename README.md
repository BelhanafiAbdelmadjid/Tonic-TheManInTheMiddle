# Spoofing Project

This project is designed to demonstrate a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack using a Flask web server. The primary goal is to understand how data can be intercepted and manipulated between clients and servers.

## Features

- Captures and logs HTTP requests and responses.
- Provides a simple web interface to display intercepted data.
- Demonstrates the vulnerability of HTTP connections.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spoofing-project.git
   cd spoofing-project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Before running the project, ensure you have the necessary permissions and that you understand the ethical implications of this type of project. Use it only in a controlled environment and for educational purposes.

## How to Start the Project

1. **Obtain SSL Certificates**:
   If you are running the application over HTTPS, make sure to obtain SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt or generate self-signed certificates.

2. **Run the Flask Server**:

   Open a terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   python web_server.py
   ```

   The server will start listening on `0.0.0.0` at port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS, if configured).

3. **Access the Web Interface**:

   Open a web browser and go to:

   - For HTTP: `http://localhost:80`
   - For HTTPS: `https://localhost:443`

4. **Start Intercepting**:
   The application will capture HTTP requests and display them in the web interface.
